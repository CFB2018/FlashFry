FlashFry
=======

FlashFry is a fast and flexible command-line tool for characterizing large numbers of CRISPR guide sequences. Many similar tools exist, but there is a clear need for a simple, lightweight framework that can score thousands of guides simultaneously for use in genome-wide screens and methods development. FlashFry allows users to specify an unconstrained number of mismatches to putative off-targets, richly annotate discovered sites, and implements many of the commonly used on and off-target scoring metrics. Output is provided as an easy to manipulate text file, and code is provided for post-run analysis in R or Python.
